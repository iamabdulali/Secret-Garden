                <p class="gardener-description">The first secret garden NFT collection is based on the Monstera . This
                    is a famous plant all around the world loved by people & influencers. Monstera & CO collection was
                    created as a pilot collection. Our main goal is to build a community, have a real test of our rarity
                    & pricing system. We want to gather as much information as possible to move on together and build
                    solid foundations for the future of SecretGarden.</p>

                <p class="gardener-heading">Basic design of the collection</p>
                <p class="gardener-description">Every design is unique and handmade by a graphic designer. The point was
                    to make a simple design, easily recognizable so it can find it’s place as a collectible NFT
                    collection. You can find more information about the creative process in the « meet the gardener »
                    section.</p>

                <p class="gardener-description"> Every collection will have a specific background but the same rarity
                    code with the pot’s color. The different details are here to highlight this rarity according to the
                    real plant characteristics. Monstera Deliciosa is a tropical plant initially growing in Mexico &
                    Guatemala in the tropical area. It’s one of the famous plant in the world. Some plants have a
                    genetic mutation leading to a lack of chlorophyll and a white pigmentation of the leaves. </p>

                <p class="gardener-description"> Two new species came from that. The Monstera Thai Constellation with
                    spotting white pigmentation on the leaves and Monstera Albo with partial/complete white leaves. The
                    whiter you have the rarest the plant is, and so is your NFT Details.</p>

                    world
                    and new technologies. Still when I first heard about NFTs, I was skeptical because I had never taken
                    the
                    time to do substantial research on the matter. After a lot of digging into the details of this new
                    universe, I found myself looking around the OpenSea marketplace, screening new NFT projects. Just
                    like
                    crypto currencies, it was more of a way to stay in touch with something huge for the future:
                    something I
                    found hugely interesting. </p>

            <div class="meet-the-gardener-div trigger-div">
                <p class="gardener-heading">The trigger</p>
                <p class="gardener-description">During one of my digging sessions, I was on a call with my girlfriend
                    trying
                    to explain to her how impressed I was in my discoveries of this brand-new world. I have to tell you
                    that
                    her big passion is for plants. We have a lot of those in our apartment and I tried to show her the
                    diversity in NFTs by trying to look for plant related NFTs. I was quite surprised to find a
                    ridiculous
                    amount of those in Opensea. I tried to go on different marketplaces … it was the same. Without my
                    noticing it, the seed was planted…
                    I started a new job in mid-2021. I was working abroad and I had a lot of spare time. The idea of
                    creating a collection had been in the back of my head; I started to work relentlessly on the
                    project.
                    After spending a lot of time on the different marketplaces, I realized that a huge percentage of
                    collections were very similar. Different layers with different backgrounds: the random generation of
                    NFTs etc… but I wanted to do something unique.</p>

                    <p class="gardener-heading">The beginning</p>
                    <p class="gardener-description">Spending time with my girlfriend sometimes means spending time in
                        plant markets. I see a lot of diversity, a lot of beauty, in those spaces and I wanted to funnel
                        this admiration into an NFT collection. I began to draw on my own, and quickly realized I needed
                        someone to work with me on this. After quite some time, we narrowed our selection of plants down
                        to 100, and that was the end of our first draft for the collection. The idea was to build our
                        collection around a single type of plant, the Monstera Deliciosa. The Monstera Deliciosa is
                        famous across both the plant world and the internet. It also happens to be my girlfriend’s
                        favorite plant. </p>

                    <p class="gardener-description">I really want to develop more than just a single collection. I want
                        to develop something that matters on the long term. I want to show the diversity of this
                        beautiful world with multiple collections. My goal is to highlight my fascination for it with a
                        beautiful design, and also to explore my fundamental love of geek universe through the rarity
                        process.</p>

                <p class="gardener-description">I am not a fan of the random generation, but I love the rarity concept.
                    I’ve also been a fan of trading card games and item customization in video games. I wanted to bring
                    that into my collection. I decided to put the rarity color code found in many video games
                    (grey=common, blue=rare, purple=epic, orange=legendary) into the pot color of the plant. As such,
                    anyone can easily see the rarity of each item inside the collection. I spent a lot of time thinking
                    about the collection: the social presence, the marketing, and I’ve decided to surround myself with
                    people to move in a direction I love.</p>

                <p class="gardener-description">Since starting this project, I have found a lot of information saying
                    that it’s not about the art: it’s about creating an investment opportunity, which I absolutely see.
                    The approach I’ve taken is to not only make something that looks smooth and natural, but something
                    which also serves as an investment. Whether you are a plant lover or an NFT lover, I really hope
                    that you’ll find your place somewhere within my words and my ideas. I’m just a simple passionate guy
                    who wants to share and enjoy with people. For the first time you have the chance to enter a brand
                    new promising project not just as a buyer but as a part-owner of it. This collection is just the
                    beginning and I really hope you’ll be there with me to write the following chapters of this
                    incredible story. </p>

                            NFTs. That is why I am creating a special Giveaway scheme, the Harvesting Plan. The plan is
